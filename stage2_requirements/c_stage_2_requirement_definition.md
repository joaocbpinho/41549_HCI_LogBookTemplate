# Scenarios

## Scenario 1: João organizes a football game
João wants to organize a football game with his friends, but the manual process is time-consuming. He discovers an app that allows him to search for available fields, view schedules and prices, and invite friends directly.

He selects a field, invites his friends via WhatsApp, and the costs are automatically divided. On the day of the game, he receives a reminder with the booking details. The entire process happens without phone calls or complications.

## Scenario 2: Manuel modernizes his sports complex
Manuel manages a sports complex and spends a lot of time with manual bookings. He adopts a platform that allows clients to book climbing sessions online, view available times, and receive automatic confirmations.

He sets maintenance blocks and defines rules to avoid no-shows. The platform reduces phone calls and improves space occupancy, allowing Manuel to focus on improving services.

## Scenario 3: João is invited to a game
João receives a notification from a friend who organized a football game through the app. The message includes the time, location, and a link to confirm participation.

Already having an account on the app and money in his virtual wallet, João accepts the invitation with a click, and the reservation fee is automatically split between the participants. On the day of the game, he receives a reminder with the event details. The process is simple, with no need for lengthy messages or concerns about payments.
