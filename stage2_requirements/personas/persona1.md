## Background

João is a Computer Engineering student at the University of Aveiro. He has always enjoyed sports and played federated football until he started university. With the intense study schedule and variable hours, he now prefers to organize casual games with friends to relax and stay active. He lives in a shared apartment with colleagues and has a strong interest in technology, frequently using apps and digital platforms to simplify his daily life.

## Daily Life

João’s day starts early with classes or group projects. He spends most of his time on campus, moving between classrooms, the library, and cafés where he studies and socializes. In the evening or late afternoon, he likes to unwind and looks for opportunities to engage in sports. Since he can't always go to the gym, he tries to organize football, padel, or tennis games with friends. However, coordinating everything (location, group availability, and field booking) can be a challenge. He relies on his phone for almost everything, from studying to making plans with friends via WhatsApp or social media.

## Goals & Needs

* Wants a quick and simple way to find and book sports fields nearby.

* Needs a user-friendly platform to check availability and split costs with friends.

* Would like to receive alternative schedule suggestions if the desired field is unavailable.

* Seeks a hassle-free experience - without phone calls or endless message exchanges.

## Pain Points & Challenges

* Difficulty finding available fields at convenient times.

* The booking process often requires phone calls or in-person visits.

* Organizing groups and managing payments among friends is complicated.

* Rental prices can be high for a student.

## Motivation

*"I want to book a game quickly and without hassle. I just need to know where free fields are and split costs with friends effortlessly."*

João values convenience. If he can book a field in just a few clicks and ensure all his friends know when and where to play, he will use this solution regularly.
