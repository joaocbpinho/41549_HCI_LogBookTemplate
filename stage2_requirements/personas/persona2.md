**Name:** Manuel Ferreira
**Age:** 45
**Occupation:** Sports Complex Manager
**Location:** Porto, Portugal

## Background

Manuel is the owner and manager of a sports complex that includes a large **indoor climbing wall**, along with a functional gym and other leisure activities. He entered the industry a few years ago when he noticed that climbing was becoming increasingly popular among both beginners and experienced athletes. Despite having a solid customer base, bookings are still managed via phone calls or in-person visits, which makes organization and communication with clients challenging.

## Daily Life

Manuel arrives at his facility around 9:00 AM to check the dayâ€™s reservations and coordinate facility maintenance. Throughout the day, he handles phone calls from clients who want to book climbing sessions, reserve instructors, or inquire about schedules. Additionally, he has to manage staff, maintain equipment, and handle billing. Outside of business hours, he would like to manage bookings more easily without constantly answering calls.

## Goals & Needs

* Wants a platform that simplifies the management of climbing session bookings.

* Needs a system that allows him to block specific times for wall maintenance or private events.

* Aims to reduce the need for phone calls by making bookings more automated.

* Would like to attract more customers by offering a modern and user-friendly online booking system.

## Pain Points & Challenges

* Wastes time with manual reservations and disorganized scheduling.

* Difficulty quickly communicating changes to clients (e.g., climbing wall maintenance).

* Issues with no-shows, where clients book sessions but do not attend, occupying slots that could have been used by others.

* Lacks a simple system to adjust schedules and manage space occupancy efficiently.

## Motivation

*"I want to manage my climbing facility more efficiently and modernly. If customers can book online and I can update schedules easily, I can focus on improving the service and attracting more people."*

Manuel is looking for a digital solution that will help him optimize his time, reduce errors, and provide a more professional and organized experience for his clients.
