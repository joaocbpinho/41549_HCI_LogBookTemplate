# A. Stage 0 - Planning and Problem Identification
>The problem domain is sports.
>The objectives are to facilitate access to sports (access to places for practicing them) for clients. In other words, the problem is the lack of organization in sports complexes.

# Context
The application area is sports. The group's idea arose due to their bad experiences when trying to use sports complexes. It is an interesting area because there are not many solutions to this problem.

# Challenges
The main objectives are to make booking spaces for sports practice easier and efficient.
Many sports complexes use booking via phone calls or even require people to go there in person, which causes disorganization and inconvenience. This can lead to a lack of interest from people looking for the service.
With this approach, sports complexes gain visibility, potentially attracting more people to practice sports using their services.

# The goal
Facilitate sports practice.
